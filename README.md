# Students Exam Score Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes students' exam scores with a focus on key columns:

- `Gender`
- `EthnicGroup`
- `ParentEduc`
- `LunchType`
- `TestPrep`
- `ParentMaritalStatus`
- `PracticeSport`
- `IsFirstChild`
- `NrSiblings`
- `TransportMeans`
- `WklyStudyHours`
- `MathScore`
- `ReadingScore`
- `WritingScore`

## Key Points

- `EthnicGroup`, `ParentEduc`, `TestPrep`, `ParentMaritalStatus`, `PracticeSport`, `IsFirstChild`, `NrSiblings`, `TransportMeans`, and `WklyStudyHours` have missing values.

## Relationships

- **Gender & Scores:** Explore correlations between gender and exam scores. Are there gender-based variations in performance?

- **Parental Factors & Scores:** Investigate the impact of parental education, marital status, and test preparation on exam performance. Do students with more educated parents or those who took test preparation courses perform better?

- **Lifestyle & Scores:** Analyze how weekly study hours, sports practice, and transportation means relate to exam scores. Does a specific lifestyle correlate with higher scores?

## Data Visualization

Heatmap: Visualize correlations between columns to identify key influencers on scores. This will help in understanding which factors are most strongly correlated with exam performance.

- Pie Chart: Illustrate the distribution of students across different ethnic groups to highlight diversity. This can offer insights into the composition of the dataset.

## Analysis Details

1. Ethnic Group Impact:
   - Examine if there are significant score variations among different ethnic groups. Utilize a pie chart to visualize the distribution of students across ethnicities.

2. Parental Education and Test Preparation:
   - Compare the scores of students based on their parents' education levels. Additionally, analyze whether students who took test preparation courses perform better than those who did not.

3. Lifestyle and Academic Performance:
   - Investigate the relationship between weekly study hours, participation in sports, and transportation means with exam scores. Utilize a heatmap to visualize correlations.

4. Gender Disparities:
   - Explore if there are any noticeable differences in exam scores between genders. Use visualizations such as pie charts or bar graphs to represent these differences.

## Conclusion

This README provides a comprehensive guide for analyzing the dataset, including key columns, suggested relationships, and detailed analysis points. Use these insights to draw meaningful conclusions about the factors influencing students' exam scores.
